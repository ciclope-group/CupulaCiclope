* &(G|T)LSxxxyyybbtttll#: Get status response
The response to the "Get status" command is normally  &GLSxxxyyybbtttll#.
If a calibration routine has just been performed, the response is &TLSxxxyyybbtttll#.

The response is coded as follows
** L: last action and dome status
   L = 0x80 OR (status_az << 4) OR last_action

*** Status az:
- RUN_CCW	0	running  counterclockwise
- STOPPED	1	stopped
- RUN_CW	2	running clockwise
- MOVING_TO	3	moving to
- PARKING         4	parking
- GOING_HOME      5	Going home
- AT_HOME         6	at home
- CALIB_AZ        7	calibrating

*** last_action:
- NONE            0	none
- RUNR_BU         1	run CW by user
- RUNL_BU         2	run CCW by user
- STOP_BU         3	stop by user
- GOTO_BU         4	go to by user
- CALIB_BU        5	calibrate by user
- HOME_BU         6	home by user
- STOP_LK         12	stop motor stalled
- EM_STOP         13	emergency stop
** S: last action and shutter status
   Ignore
** xxx: dome position
   Codes in three characters the current position of the dome.

   The coding is made using the seven least significant bits of each
   character and setting to one the most significant one.

   So, if xxx was 0x8095F3 (10000000 10010101 11110011) it would be
   coding the binary 0000000 0010101 1110011 =  0xAF3 = 2803.
   If the response to the "Get status" command (&G#) begins with &T instead
   of  &G is because a calibration routine has just been performed, and the
   xxx field doesn't mean the dome position but the number of encoder ticks
   in a round i.e in 360 degrees.

**  yyy: shutter position
    Ignore.
** bb: motor supply voltage
   Codes in two characters the voltage it is being supplied to the motor (12V).

   The coding is similar to xxx, the most significant bit is set to one.
   To translate the value to volts, it is enough to multiply it by 15 and
   divide by 1024.
   This way, if bb was 0x86C4 (10000110 11000100), corresponding the binary
   0000110 1000100 = 0x344 =  836, which in volts is 12,25V.

** ttt: shutter close temporization
   Ignorar
** ll: Button and sensor status
   - 10      -->     Home sensor
   - 11      -->     Right button
   - 12      -->     Stop button
   - 13      -->     Left button
